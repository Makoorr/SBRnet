This is my first FULL STACK website. <br />
I used this opportunity to familiarize myself and learn more about web development fundamentals using: <br />
  -html,css and js for the frontend part (i also used some libraries like bootstrap to help) <br />
  -for the backend part, i used php <br />

This was fun and enlightning! <br />

It is currently deployed at www.sbrswitchmed.com , check it out!
