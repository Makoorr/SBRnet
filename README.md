This is my first FULL STACK website.
I used this opportunity to familiarize myself and learn more about web development fundamentals using: 
  -html,css and js for the frontend part (i also used some frameworks like bootstrap to help)
  -for the backend part, i used php

This was fun and enlightning!

Thanks,
